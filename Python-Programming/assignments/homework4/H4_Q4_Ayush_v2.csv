Language,Summary,Strengths,Weaknesses
Python,"Versatile, high-level language with dynamic semantics for general-purpose programming; popular in data science.","Easy to learn, Extensive libraries","Slower execution, Limited threading due to GIL."
R,Language and environment for statistical computing and graphics; widely used by statisticians and data miners.,"Comprehensive statistical tools, Superior data visualization","Less memory efficient, Steeper learning curve."
Rust,Multi-paradigm system language focused on safety and performance; not traditionally for data science.,"Memory safety without GC, Concurrency without data races","Steeper learning curve, Smaller data science ecosystem."
Scala,"High-level, statically typed language integrating object-oriented and functional features; used in big data.","JVM compatibility, Good for big data applications","Complex language features, Smaller community."
Julia,"High-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing with familiar syntax.","High-performance for numerical computing, Easy to write and read code","Younger ecosystem, Fewer libraries."
