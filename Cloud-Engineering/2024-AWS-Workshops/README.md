# AWS Workshops

These workshops will provide an overview of several foundational AWS Services, demonstrate how they can be used to configure and deploy resources in your account, and how you can then interact with those deployed resources from your development environment.

## Workshop #1

- [IAM](./IAM): Learn about Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control permissions in AWS. We will set up IAM Identity Center, create an Admin user, and configure the AWS CLI with credentials.
- [Cost](./Cost): Set Budgets, track costs, and configure reports.
- [S3](./S3): Explore common S3 (Simple Storage Service) features, create a bucket, and upload data from both the CLI and the Python SDK: `boto3`.
- [RDS](./RDS): Use the Relational Database Service to deploy a database server, learn about Security Groups, and connect to your database with `sqlalchemy`.

## Workshop #2

- [EC2](./EC2): Learn how to deploy, configure, and connect to virtual machines with Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
- [ECS](./ECS): Use the Elastic Container Service (ECS) from AWS to easily deploy container workloads. Configure an Application Load Balancer to distribute and direct traffic to your applications. We will see an example of both Task (data processing job) and Service (web application).

## Workshop #3

- [SQS](./SQS): Use the Simple Queue Service (SQS) to decouple processes and broker messages.
- [S3 Notifications](./S3/notifications): Configure an S3 bucket to generate notifications for events such as new file upload.
- [Lambda](./Lambda): Learn about access control in AWS, create an Admin user, and configure the AWS CLI with credentials.
