# Coding Workflow

### Steps:

1) Setup Environment:
    - Create Virtual Environment
    - Install environment dependencies
    - Set up version control:
        - Initialize Git repository
        - Create a GitHub repository for team collaboration
        - Set up Git remote repository
    - Organize project structure:
        - Create directories for data, code, models, documentation, etc.
        - Define naming conventions and folder structures

2) Code Development
    - Write clean and modular code:
        - Use descriptive variable and function names
        - Apply object-oriented principles if applicable
        - Ensure readability and maintainability

3) Code Review and Refactoring
    - Refactor code to improve readability, performance, and maintainability
    - Externalize configurations
    - Add logging
    - Add error handling
    - Add documentation and comments
    - Review code manually
    - Run static analysis tools (e.g., Pylint, Flake8) to identify potential issues
    - Resolve warnings and errors
    - Commit changes locally

3) Unit Testing and CICD
    - Add and test ML model variation
    - Add and validate unit tests
    - Run code coverage analysis
    - Automate unit testing and coverage
    - Issue pull request
